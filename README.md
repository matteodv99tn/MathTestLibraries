#Mathematical Test Library in C++

This repository contains a personal implementation of basic mathematical object and function that will also be used with some numerical method.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand how to implement mathematical entities (such matrices, vectors or complex numbers) developing libraries in `C++`. The aim is to create a functional code that's optimized as good as possible, but any contribution is happily accepted.
